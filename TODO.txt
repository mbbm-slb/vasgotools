# Keep the ideas and plans for improvement here

2025-08-06:
- Update Workspace: if you added, removed or renamed modules within the workspace
- Add buildfiles to workspace: assume build.bat in every module
- Add jenkinsfiles to workspace (applications? But applications are not neccesarily buildable)
- Create/Update Vendor folder for workspace/modules?
- Create prebuild.bat for modules (gofmt, vat, vulncheck, documentation, ...)
- Create postbuild.bat for workspace (Installer for services, docker for services, ...)
- Docker?
